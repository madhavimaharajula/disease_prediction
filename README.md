**Disease Prediction from Medical Data
Project Overview:**

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a disease based on medical data such as symptoms, patient history, and other relevant features. By leveraging classification algorithms and datasets with labeled medical records, the model helps to provide insights that can aid healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

**Objectives:**

Analyze medical data to identify patterns and relationships between symptoms, medical history, and disease occurrence.
Develop a classification model to predict the likelihood of a disease based on input features.
Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
Datasets:

The model uses publicly available medical datasets containing labeled records with various features, such as:

Patient demographics (age, gender, etc.)
Medical history (previous conditions, family history)
Symptoms (e.g., cough, fever, etc.)
Diagnostic test results (if available)
Machine Learning Techniques:

This project applies various classification algorithms, including:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Trees
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC curve.
